   - All text seems to render differently (the aliasing in the original is white, but mine is coloured). It's an extremely subtle difference but I have no idea how to change this.
   - The Netmatters logo in the header is stretched vertically in the original by less than a pixel, no idea why/how as I'm using the same image file. I thought it'd be better if I preserve the image quality instead of arbitrarily replicating it.
   - The call button's border is slightly less wide in my version, as the icon I used is a bit smaller and I couldn't warp its dimensions without messing up the entire header/nav layout. Right now, it lines up from the bottom left with the original.
   - The lines in my burger button don't line up with the original, again because I used an icon whereas the original renders animatable lines in CSS. However, I made the 'Menu' text align with the original.
   - The linear gradient over the banner image isn't a 100% match, because the original element is done in JavaScript so I can't reference the exact values easily. I've got it as close as I can get by eye.
   - I used a different arrow in the two buttons that contain them, resulting in a slightly different text alignment. The buttons are otherwise identical.
   - I have not implemented carousel image slider buttons. I asked in the Discord if I should add dummy ones and the answer was no.
   - All the icons in the cards are different, but everything else is identical.
   - As I opted to make each article layout consistent, my images appear 1px smaller than their originals, and the second article's image is given the same border as the other two. I'll probably ask about this anomaly in the pod meeting tomorrow.
   - The box shadow spreads to the sides of my articles, while in the original it only displays at the bottom, despite using indentical property values. Not sure how to fix this. Again, I might ask about this in the pod meeting. The articles are otherwise identical.
   - The checkbox in the newsletter form uses a different tick icon, and for some reason mine can't be checked within Dev Tools, but I'm hoping this doesn't mean it's unselectable on touch screens. Other than that, they're identical.
   - The icons within the social media cards in the footer are slightly different sizes than those in the original, but they're aligned the same. Everything else is identical.
